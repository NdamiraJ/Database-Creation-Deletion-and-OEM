## OEM Access Attempt

- Tried accessing: `https://localhost:5500/em`
- Result: "Not Implemented â€” The requested method GET is not implemented for URL /em"
- Cause: OEM endpoint not available or unsupported in Oracle Free 23c
- Action Taken: Used SQL Developer to monitor PDBs and users instead

Here is a screenshot:
